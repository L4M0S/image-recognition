# image-recognition
Repo for a small image recognition project in python

## Setup

#### Dependencies

Before running the project, download and install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) and [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

## Run

First, run `python 2-hist.py` to generate the image features to feed the neural network. Then, run `python multi-layer.py` to actually run the neural network that recognizes the image patterns.
